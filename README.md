# ECM1410-CA3-Social-Media-Java


Joint coding project for Object Oriented programming first year module at Exeter University for Computer Science. Objective 
is to design the backend of a very simple social media platform and implement the functionality of 2 interfaces. This CA
comprises 50% of the overall module assessment.

Assignment

The University of Knowledge (UoK) is extremely pleased with the partnership with their students in the development
of their own systems. The experience has been shown to be positive to all. Now, the UoK is planning to create its own
social media platform. In order to balance the workload among the students, the UoK divided the system development
in two groups, front-end and back-end. This assignment is based around the development of a back-end Java package
for the UoK. It has already determined the functionality required of the system, and has provided an interface to be
used between the back-end you develop, and the front-end the other group is developing. UoK staff should be able to
simply compile in the jar file of the package you develop, with the rest of their system, to result in a fully functioning
solution.
